    &lt;h3&gt;Edit Edge Without Drag&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The editWithoutDrag function receives from and to ids. According to the
    documentation it has always been that way. But in 5.4.1 (and for 3 year prio
    to this release) the manipulation.editEdge.editEdgeWithoutDrag function
    received internal node objects instead. As of 6.0.0 the behavior is in line
    with the documentation and other similar methods that is the from and to
    properties now contain the ids directly.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Old code that no longer works:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;
const options = {
  manipulation: {
    editEdge: {
      editWithoutDrag({ from, to }) {
        const fromId = from.id
        const toId = to.id
        &amp;#x2026;
      }
    }
  }
}
      &lt;/pre
  &gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New code that achieves the same result:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;
const options = {
  manipulation: {
    editEdge: {
      editWithoutDrag({ from: fromId, to: toId }) {
        &amp;#x2026;
      }
    }
  }
}
      &lt;/pre
  &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
